## Key Insights

- **Apple** leads in both **revenue** and **net income**, the only company appearing in both top-10 lists.
- **Alibaba** (Retail sector) shows the **highest revenue growth**, reaching **+75.94%**, based on our 3-year growth formula.
- The **United States** is home to the most global giants (**38 companies**) and dominates across sectors like **Retail**, **Media**, and **Beverages**.
- The **United Kingdom** comes second in company count and has strong representation across multiple industries.
- **Profit efficiency** (profit margin) is led by companies like **Telia Eesti**, **Danske Bank**, and **SEB Bank**, all exceeding 90% average margins.
- Despite high revenue, some companies (e.g., Sinopec, BP) show relatively lower margins, highlighting operational inefficiencies.
- The map highlights a dense concentration in **North America and Western Europe**, with sparse representation in **Africa and South America**.
- **Bombardier Inc.** and **PandaDoc** are operating with negative average profit margins. This could reflect high operating costs, restructuring, or heavy investments. On the other end, **Apple** shows an unusually high average margin of 100.6%, which suggests an artifact in the data
